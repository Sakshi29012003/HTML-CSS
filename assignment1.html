        <p>Continental India organised the 2-Wheeler TechDrive to demonstrate some of the most advanced safety tech for two-wheelers.
         These technologies are targeted at mainstream two-wheelers and includes ABS, traction control, rider assistance systems, and
          more.</p>

          <p>Continental India organised the 2-Wheeler TechDrive at Taneja Aerospace & Aviation Limited, a private airport near Hosur,
             on the outskirts of Bangalore to demonstrate some of these technologies and for us to experience some more of them. Well,
             a lot of slipping and sliding ensued throughout the day, all in the name of automotive safety of course.</p>
